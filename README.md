# LangAcq1
A simple language learning environment and agent.

### Environment
One or two objects (card suites) move in the 'scene.'  
Objects have colors (yellow, red, blue, or green).  

The environment outputs:
- the features (shape and color) and locations of objects in the scene
  - a feature is a one-hot vector
  - the location is indicated in a 2D map
- text describing the scene
